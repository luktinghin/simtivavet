### About
SimTIVA.vet is a computer simulation program to simulate the delivery of TCI/TIVA for veterinary anaesthesia. It shares the same code as SimTIVA, a TCI/TIVA simulation program for humans. It is a progressive web app and can be run in desktop and mobile browsers across all platforms. Broad cross platform support based on modern web technology means it can be accessed on a wide range of devices. In addition, a simple installation process enables SimTIVA to be run like a native app on your device, and even without internet access. 

This is an open source project; created by Terence Luk 2024; licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0.

Coding is done in JavaScript. The code to mathematical calculations are based on STANPUMP, created by Dr. Steven Shafer, freely available on [OpenTCI](http://opentci.org/code/stanpump).

The pharmacological models include Beths & Cattai for propofol, and Cattai for fentanyl, for use in dogs.

Several modes are available on SimTIVA app. CP targeting is useful if you want to emulate the behavior of a TCI pump. An infusion scheme will be generated to guide you to achieve a CP target using any ordinary syringe pump without TCI functionality. Manual mode allows you to input bolus and infusion doses and SimTIVA will calculate the CP in response to these doses and plot the result over time.
